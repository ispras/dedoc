ABSTRACT: Authors of papers to proceedings have to type these in a form suitable for direct photographic 
reproduction by the publisher. In order to ensure uniform style throughout the volume, all the papers have to 
be  prepared  strictly  according  to  the  instructions  set  below.  The  enclosed  CPI_AR_PDF1.7.joboptions 
should be used to create the final Camera Ready Copy PDF file. The publisher will reduce the camera-
ready copy to 75% and print it in black only. For the convenience of the authors  template files for MS Word 



6.0 (and higher) are provided. 

1  GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS 


1.1  Type area 

The text should fit exactly into the type area of 187 
  272  mm  (7.36"    10.71").  For  correct  settings  of 
margins  in  the  Page  Setup  dialog  box  (File  menu) 
see Table 1.  


1.2  Typefont, typesize and spacing 

Use  Times  New  Roman  12  point  size  and  13  point 
line  spacing  (Normal;text  tag).  Use  roman  type  ex-
cept  for  the  headings  (Heading  tags),  parameters  in 
mathematics (not for log, sin, cos, ln, max., d (in dx), 
etc),  Latin  names  of  species  and  genera  in  botany 
and  zoology  and  the  titles  of  journals  and  books 
which should all be in italics. Never use bold, except 
to  denote  vectors  in  mathematics.  Never  underline 
any text. Use the small font (10 points on 11 points) 
for  tables  (Table  tags),  figure  captions  (Figure  cap-
tion tag) and the references (Reference text tag). 


Never use letterspacing and never use more than 
one space after each other. 


2  GETTING STARTED 


2.1  Preparing the new file with the correct template 

Copy the template file B2ProcA4.dot (if you print on 
A4 size paper) or B2ProcLe.dot (for Letter size pa-
per) to the template directory. This directory can be 
found by selecting the Tools menu, Options and then 
by tabbing the File Locations. When the Word pro-
gramme  has  been  started  open  the  File  menu  and 
choose New. Now select the template B2ProcA4.dot 


or B2ProcLe.dot (see above). Start by renaming the 
document  by  clicking  Save  As  in  the  menu  Files. 
Name  your  file  as  follows:  First  three  letters  of  the 
file name should be the first three letters of the last 
name  of  the  first  author,  the  second  three  letters 
should  be  the  first  letter  of  the  first  three  words  of 
the  title  of  the  paper  (e.g.  this  paper:  balpat.doc). 
Now you can type your  paper, or  copy the old ver-
sion of your paper onto this new formated file. 


2.2  Copying old text onto new file 

Open your old file and the new file. Switch between 
these two with the Window menu. Select all text of 
the old file (excluding title, authors, affiliations and 
abstract)  and  paste  onto  bottom  of  new  file,  after 
having deleted the word INTRODUCTION (see also 
section  2.5).  Check  the  margin  setting  (Page  Setup 
dialog  box  in  File  menu)  and  column  settings  (see 
Table 1 for correct settings). After this copy the texts 
which have to be placed in the frames (see sections 


2.3 and 2.4 ). In order to avoid disruption of the text

and frames, copy these texts paragraph by paragraph 
without including the first word (which includes the  
old tag). It is best to first retype the first words man-
ually and then to paste the correct text behind. When 
the new file contains all the text, the old tags in the 
text  should  be  replaced  by  the  new  Balkema  tags 
(see  section  3).  Before  doing  this  apply  automatic 
formatting (AutoFormat in Format menu). 


2.3  Title, author and affiliation frame 

Place the cursor on the T of Title at the top of your 
newly  named  file  and  type  the  title  of  the  paper  in 
lower  case  (no  caps  except  for  proper  names).  The 
title should not be longer than 75 characters). Delete 
the  word  Title  (do  not  delete  the  paragraph  end). 
Place the cursor on the A of A.B.Author(s) and type 
the name of the first author (first the initials and then 
the  last  name).  If  any  of  the  co-authors  have  the 
same affiliation as the first author, add his name af-
ter an & (or a comma if more names follow). Delete 
the  words  A.B.  Author  etc.  and  place  the  cursor  on 
the  A  of  Affiliation.  Type  the  correct  affiliation 
(Name  of  the  institute,  City,  State/Province,  Coun-
try). Now delete the word Affiliation. If there are au-
thors  linked  to  other  institutes,  place  the  cursor  at 
the  end  of  the  affiliation  line  just  typed  and  give  a 
return. Now type the name(s) of the author(s) and af-
ter a return the affiliation. Repeat this procedure un-
til all affiliations have been typed.  


All these texts fit in a frame which should not be 
changed  (Width:  Exactly  187  mm  (7.36");  Height: 
Exactly  73  mm  (2.87")  from  top  margin;  Lock  an-
chor). 


2.4  Abstract frame 

If  there  are  no  further  authors  place  the  cursor  one 
space  behind  the  word  ABSTRACT:  and  type  your 
abstract of not more than 150 words. The top of the 
first line of the abstract will be 73 mm (2.87") from 
the  top  of  the  type  area.  The  complete  abstract  will 
fall  in  the  abstract  frame,  the  settings  of  which 
should also not be changed (Width: Exactly 187 mm 
(7.36"); Height: Automatic; Vertical 73 mm (2.87") 
from margin; Lock anchor). 


2.5  First line of text or heading 

If your text starts with a heading, place the cursor on 
the I of INTRODUCTION and type the correct text 
for the heading. Now delete the word INTRODUC-
TION and start with the text after a return. This text 
should have the tag First paragraph. 


If  your  text  starts  without  a  heading  you  should 
place  the  cursor  on  the  I  of  INTRODUCTION, 


change the tag to First paragraph and type your text 
after deleting the word INTRODUCTION. 


3  LAYOUT OF TEXT 


3.1  Text and indenting 

Text  is  set  in  two  columns  of  9  cm  (3.54")  width 
each  with  7  mm  (0.28")  spacing  between  the  col-
umns.  All  text  should  be  typed  in  Times  New  Ro-
man, 12 pt on 13 pt line spacing except for the paper 
title (18 pt on 20 pt), author(s) (14 pt on 16 pt), and 
the small text in tables, captions and references (10 
pt on 11 pt). All line spacing is exact. Never add any 
space  between  lines  or  paragraphs.  When  a  column 
has blank lines at the bottom of the page, add space 
above and below headings (see opposite column). 


First lines of paragraphs are indented 5 mm (0.2") 
except for paragraphs after a heading or a blank line 
(First paragraph tag). 


3.2  Headings 

Type  primary  headings  in  capital  letters  roman 
(Heading 1 tag) and secondary and tertiary  headings 
in lower case italics (Headings 2 and 3 tags). Head-
ings  are  set  flush  against  the  left  margin.  The  tag 
will give two blank lines (26 pt) above and one (13 
pt) beneath the primary headings, 1½ blank lines (20 
pt) above and a ½ blank line (6 pt) beneath the sec-
ondary  headings  and  one  blank  line  (13  pt)  above 
the tertiary headings. Headings are not indented and 
neither are the first lines of text following the head-
ing  indented.  If  a  primary  heading  is  directly  fol-
lowed  by  a  secondary  heading,  only  a  ½  blank  line 
should be set between the two headings. In the Word 
programme this has to be done manually as follows: 
Place the cursor on the primary heading, select Par-
agraph  in  the  Format  menu,  and  change  the  setting 
for spacing after, from 13 pt to 0 pt. In the same way 
the setting in the secondary heading for spacing be-
fore should be changed from 20 pt to 7 pt. 


3.3  Listing and numbering 

When listing facts use either the style tag List signs 
or the style tag List numbers. 


3.4  Equations 

Use  the  equation  editor  of  the  selected  word  pro-
cessing  programme.  Equations  are  not  indented 
(Formula tag). Number equations consecutively and 
place the number with the tab key at the end of the 
line, between parantheses. Refer to equations by the-
se numbers. See for example Equation 1 below: 


 From the above we note that sin  = (x + y)z or:




where  ca  =  interface  adhesion;    =  friction  angle  at 
interface; and k1 = shear stiffness number. 
For simple equations in the text always use super-
script  and  subscript  (select  Font  in  the  Format 
menu). Do not use the equation editor between text 
on same line. 


The  inline  equations  (equations  within  a  sen-
tence) in the text will automatically be converted to 
the AMS notation standard. 


3.5  Tables 

Locate  tables  close  to  the  first  reference  to  them  in 
the  text  and  number  them  consecutively.  Avoid  ab-
breviations in column headings. Indicate units in the 
line  immediately  below  the  heading.  Explanations 
should  be  given  at  the  foot  of  the  table,  not  within 
the table itself. Use only horizontal rules: One above 
and  one  below  the  column  headings  and  one  at  the 
foot of the table (Table rule tag: Use the Shift-minus 
key to actually type the rule exactly where you want 
it). For simple tables use the tab key and not the ta-
ble  option.  Type  all  text  in  tables  in  small  type:  10 
on  11  points  (Table  text  tag).  Align  all  headings  to 
the left of their column and start these headings with 
an initial capital. Type the caption above the table to 
the same width as the table (Table caption tag). See 
for example Table 1. 


3.6  Figure captions 

Always  use  the  Figure  caption  style  tag  (10  points 
size  on  11  points  line  space).  Place  the  caption  un-
derneath the figure (see Section 5). Type as follows: 
‘Figure 1. Caption.’ Leave about two lines of space 
between the figure caption and the text of the paper. 


3.7  References 

In the text, place the authors’ last names (without in-
itials) and the date of publication in parentheses (see 
examples in Section 5). At the end of the paper, list 
all  references  in  alphabetical  order  underneath  the 
heading  REFERENCES  (Reference  heading      tag). 
The  references  should  be  typed  in  small  text  (10  pt 
on 11 pt) and second and further lines should be in-
dented 5.0 mm (0.2") (Reference text tag). If several 
works by the same author are cited, entries should be 
chronological: 


Larch, A.A. 1996a. Development ... 
Larch, A.A. 1996b. Facilities ... 
Larch, A.A. 1997. Computer ... 
Larch, A.A. & Jensen, M.C. 1996. Effects of ... 
Larch, A.A. & Smith, B.P. 1993. Alpine ... 



3.7.1  Typography for references  

Last  name,  First  name  or  Initials  (ed.)  year.  Book  title.  City: 
Publisher. 
Last name, First name or Initials year. Title of article. Title of 
Journal (series number if necessary) volume number (issue 
number if necessary): page numbers.

3.7.3  Endnote 

We  would  appreciate  it  if  you  make  use  of  the  en-
closed Endnotes stylefile (Harvard.ens). 


3.8  Notes 

These  should  be  avoided.  Insert  the  information  in 
the  text.  In  tables  the  following  reference  marks 
should  be  used:  *,  **,  etc.  and  the  actual  footnotes  
set directly underneath the table. 


3.9  Conclusions 

Conclusions  should  state  concisely  the  most  im-
portant  propositions  of  the  paper  as  well  as  the  au-
thor’s  views  of  the  practical  implications  of  the  re-
sults. 


4  PHOTOGRAPHS AND FIGURES 


Number figures consecutively in the order in which 
reference is made to them in the text, making no dis-
tinction between diagrams and photographs. Figures 
should fit within the column width of 90 mm (3.54") 
or within the type area width of 187 mm (7.36"). 
Figures,  photographs,  etc.  can  be  in  black/white  or 
full  color,  but  will  be  produced  in  the  book  in 
black/white  only.  Please  insert  the  high  resolution 
figures (see artwork document) in the word file. Fig-
ures, etc. should not be centered, but placed against 
the  left  margin.  Leave  about  two  lines  of  space  be-
tween the actual text and figure (including caption). 
  Never  place  any  text  next  to  a  figure.  Leave  this 
space blank. The most convenient place for placing 
figures  is  at  the  top  or  bottom  of  the  page.  Avoid 
placing text between figures as readers might not no-
tice  the  text.  Keep  in  mind  that  everything  will  be 
reduced  to  75%.  Therefore,  9  point  should  be  the 
minimum size of the lettering. Lines should prefera-
  0.50  instead  of  0,50  (used  in  French  text);  9000 
instead of 9,000 but if more than 10,000: 10,000 
instead of 10000 
  14C  instead  of  C14  /  C-14  and  BP  /  BC  /  AD  in-
stead of B.P. / B.C. / A.D. 
  ×  20  instead  of  20  /  X20  /  x  20;  4  +  5  >  7  in-
stead of 4+5>7 but –8 / +8 instead of – 8 / + 8 
  e.g. / i.e. instead of e.g., / i.e., 


6  SUBMISSION OF MATERIAL TO THE 
EDITOR 


The camera-ready copy PDF file of the complete 
paper  should  be  created  with  the  enclosed 
CPI_AR_PDF1.7.joboptions  file  and  sent  to  the 
editor. Together with the MsWord or LaTeX file. 
All figures should be included as high resolution file 
in  the  PDF  and  word  file  (see  artwork  document). 
Check  whether  the  paper  looks  the  same  as  this 
sample:  Title  at  top  of  first  page  in  18  points,  au-
thors in 14 points and all other text in 12 points on 
13  points  line  space,  except  for  the  small  text  (10 
point on 11 point line space) used in tables, captions 
and  references.  Also  check  if  the  type  width  is  187 
mm  (7.36"),  the  column  width  90  mm  (3.54"),  the 
page  length  is  272  mm  (10.71")  and  that  the  space 
above the Abstact is exactly as in the sample. Write 
your  name  and  the  shortened  title  of  the  paper  in 
pencil in the bottom margin of each page and num-
ber the pages correctly. 
7  DEADLINE 


The above material should be with the editor before 
the  deadline  for  submission.  Any  material  received 
too late will not be published.  
 


bly  be  0.2  mm  (0.1")  thick.  Keep  figures  as  simple 
as possible. Avoid excessive notes and designations.

Figure  1.  Caption  of  a  typical  figure.  Photographs  will  be 
scanned by the printer. Always supply original photographs. 
 
Photographs  should  be  with  good  contrast  and 
preferably in TIFF or EPS format (see Artwork doc-
ument).  Photographic  reproductions  cut  from  books 
or  journals,  photocopies  of  photographs  and 
screened  photographs  are  unacceptable.  The  pro-
ceedings will be printed in black only. For this rea-
son  avoid  the  use  of  colour  in  figures  and  photo-
graphs. Colour is also nearly always unnecessary for 
scientific work.
